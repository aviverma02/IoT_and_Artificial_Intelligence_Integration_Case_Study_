## 🏗️ System Architecture

The AIoT framework follows a **layered architecture** designed for performance, security, and scalability:

### 🔹 Edge Layer  
IoT sensors and smart devices collect real-time environmental and operational data. Lightweight AI models perform preliminary data processing locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.

### 🔹 Network Layer  
Secure and reliable communication is established using protocols such as **MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, and 5G networks**, ensuring low-latency data transmission.

### 🔹 Processing Layer  
Cloud and fog computing platforms handle large-scale data processing, model training, and analytics using distributed computing frameworks.

### 🔹 Application Layer  
AI-driven applications generate predictions, insights, dashboards, and automated responses to support intelligent decision-making.
